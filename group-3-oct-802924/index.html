    <span class="line" style="text-align: left;">Documentary filmmaking often faces significant financial hurdles. Securing funding is crucial for</span>
    <span class="line">production, distribution and ultimately, reaching a wider audience.Fundraising events provide a</span>
    <span class="line">direct avenue to connect with potential donors and sponsors who are passionate about the</span>
    <span class="line">documentary’s subject matter. While documentaries can be entertaining, focusing solely on</span>
    <span class="line">entertainment undervalues the potential for social impact and educational value that  many</span>
    <span class="line">documents possess. Fundraising should highlight the broader goals and impact of the film.</span>

    <p class="line" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Target audience:</strong> General public like students, teachers, parents, professionals, organizations</p>

    <span class="line">organizations who are passionate about the documentary's subject matter and who are likely to</span>
    <span class="line">be interested in supporting its broader goals and impact. This could include individuals who are</span>
    <span class="line">personally affected by the documentary's topic, organizations that work in related fields, and</span>
    <span class="line">foundations or philanthropists who support social impact initiatives.</span>
